Primes
======

A simple python script using sqlite3 to calculate prime numbers and store them into a database.

You can calculate the prime numbers to the number you want (10000 for example) and store them into a database.
Later, you can easily continue to compute to another larger number without needing to recompute all the primes you already calculated.
