Primes
======

A simple python script using sqlite3 to calculate prime numbers and store them into a database.

You can calculate the prime numbers to the number you want (10000 for example) and store them into a database.
Later, you can easily compute primes to another larger number without needing to find again all the primes you already have computed before.

You need primes from an interval ? 
Read them directly from your database.

Do you want to export all your primes as a text file ?
No problem, you can do it easily.
